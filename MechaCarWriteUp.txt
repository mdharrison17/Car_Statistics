MPG Regression:

Results:
To first determine what variables were correlated to mpg by calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient.

Variables used in the mulitple linear regression model to predict mpg were vehicle length and vehicle weight

 
R-squared value of the model to determine if the model sufficiently predicts our dependent variable.

(Intercept)       1.87e-08 ***  
vehiclelength     3.05e-12 ***
vehicleweight      0.0728 
spoilerangle       0.2339    
groundclearance    2.13e-08 ***
Multiple R-squared:  0.7032,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6768

From the results above vehicle length and ground clearance are statistically unlikely  to provide random amounts of variance to the linear model.

The slope of our line would not be zero because the p-value is smaller than the significace level of .05%.  Meaning, we can state that there is sufficient evidence to reject
our null hypothesis and the slope of our linear model is not zero.

SUSPENSION COIL SUMMARY

Mean: 1498.78
Median: 1500
Variance: 62.29
Standard Deviation: 7.89

Yes, the variance is under 100 psi so the current manufacturing data meets the design specifications.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SUSPENSION COIL T-TEST

Randomly selected 50 data points, the p-value(0.5) is above the .05 percent significance level.  Therefore, we do not have sufficient evidence to reject the null
hypthesis, and we can state that the two means are statisitically similar (population mean and sample mean).

DESIGN YOUR OWN STUDY

Cost of vehicle based on vehicle class. 

Dependent variable is cost
Independent variable is vehicle class.

Car classes would be car, truck and SUV.

Null Hypothesis:  The median cost is about the same for all vehicle classes
Alternative Hypthoeses:  The median cost varies by vehicle class.

I would use the one-way ANOVA test to compare a mean cost accross vehicle classes.
